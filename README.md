# Keyword Auto-Suggestion Project

## Overview
The **Keyword Auto-Suggestion** project is an NLP-based application designed to enhance user experience by predicting the next word or providing suggestions as the user types. The project leverages techniques such as the n-gram model and a robust backend to process user inputs and return accurate suggestions in real-time.

## Features
- **Real-time Suggestions**: Provides keyword suggestions dynamically as the user types.
- **User-friendly Interface**: Clean and responsive interface for seamless interaction.
- **NLP Integration**: Utilizes Natural Language Processing techniques for accurate word prediction.
- **Backend Support**: Includes a server to handle requests and manage datasets.

## Requirements
- **Node.js**: Ensure you have Node.js installed.
- **Dependencies**:
  - Install project dependencies by running:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

## Usage
1. **Start the Server**:
   Run the server using the following command:
   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```
2. **Open the Application**:
   Open `index.html` in a web browser to interact with the interface.
3. **Input and Suggestions**:
   - Type in the input field to see real-time suggestions.

## Backend Details
The server is built using Node.js and handles requests for fetching keyword suggestions from a dataset. The logic for predicting the next word is implemented using the n-gram model.

## Frontend Details
The frontend uses `index.html`, `style.css`, and `app.js` to provide a responsive and interactive user experience. Suggestions are displayed dynamically as the user types.

## References
- **NLP Techniques**: Refer to `NLP R3.pdf` and `new NLP R3.pdf` for detailed insights into the implementation.
- **Code Documentation**: The `merger.py` script preprocesses datasets to make them ready for use in the application.
